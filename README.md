# ANPR_rashed
This project is an Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system, designed to identify and record vehicle number plates using advanced image processing and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques.

Features

Automated Number Plate Recognition: Utilizes advanced image processing techniques to detect vehicle plates.
OCR Implementation: Employs Optical Character Recognition for accurate plate text extraction.
Comprehensive Documentation: Includes a detailed report and a presentation for an in-depth understanding of the project.
Video Demonstration: A video demo provides a visual overview of the system in action.
Code Files: Contains Python files for training the ANPR system and implementing OCR.
App File: app.py is the primary executable file, designed to run in Visual Studio Code.
Example Inputs: Sample input images are provided to test the system's functionality.
Data Storage: Captured plate data is stored in a CSV file within the static folder.
User Interface: Front-end HTML file located in the template folder, offering a user-friendly interface.
